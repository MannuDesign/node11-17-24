    <h1> NoPages </h1>
    <small> The NoPages skin, unlike most jAlbum skins, does not produce any album pages. It does not generate any HTML
        or CSS
        files. The skin is more in the nature of a utility program, designed to provide a way to take images and videos
        and have
        them processed by the jAlbum image and video engines. It can be used, for example, to create high-quality scaled
        images
        from large originals or to produce thumbnails for use in contexts other than a jAlbum-produced photo album.

        If video files are added to the album project, jAlbum will process them, converting them to the MP4 format,
        placing the
        index at the beginning of the file, which enables streaming of the video (i.e., it can begin playing before the
        entire
        file has been downloaded to the visitor's computer), and reducing the overall file size considerably, generally
        without
        compromising quality. If videos are included in a regular jAlbum project, there's no need to pre-process them
        with the
        NoPages skin - this batch processing might be useful, however, if you intend to use the videos in another
        context, or if
        you want to provide them to others, not as part of an album.

        After running the album build, if you want to make changes to the skin settings, you should delete the existing
        output
        before running the build again. The skin does not have a good way of doing an effective job of cleaning up
        output
        objects that are no longer needed.

        Projects created with this skin can not be built using the jAlbum multi-maker. They need to be processed by
        opening the
        project and clicking Make album.</small>
